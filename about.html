My previous work has been eclectic- from writing a Marketing Campaign Generation API, to a web based Travel and Expense tool with a user base of thousands, to a Secure Cyber Systems. 

Work Experience of 3.5+ years at Accenture, India and Madison Logic, US has provided me opportunities to work on different software technologies. At Madison Logic, I used Node.js and AWS to develop cost effective and scalable applications. Accenture provided me opportunity to develop C++ based software solutions, driving continuous improvement to processes, workflow, and customer responsiveness.

I can write in Python, C++, C, Node.js. My interaction with softwares also involves use of Frameworks such as Flask, PySpark Map Reduce, Express-Node.js, Amazon Web Services.

The proudest moment for me was to automate a process which was done manually for previous 4 years and save client's one full time resource.
